			<p>Ad Antonio Chiuminatto, Chicago.</p>
			<p>[Torino,] 24 gennaio [1933]</p>
			<p/>
			<p>Dear Tony,</p>
			<p>now that I'm out of danger with Xmas and New Year turkey-stuffings, I can write you off a good old letter. As for politics: here's to you, hoping to encounter you at my machine-gun's end and have you cry mercy. We'll yet see that, someday, old boy. Perhaps only in the next World-war, we'll find out our true calling.</p>
			<p>But, honestly, I don't care a damn about the whole lot of it. I would soften a little, however, thinking about the 11 millions, should I not have learnt in my old school-books that world history is only a great shambles and never was something resembling fairness and humanity brought out to actuality among our gallant fathers. And thinking that the 11 millions of to-day are the result of a ten years of boasted &quot;prosperity&quot; I can't help grinning. Our literatures here in Europe are quoting merrily your unemployment figures and do you know what they find to say about? They hold you are damned lucky to have been granted the calamity, hold that your national pluck and boldness through suffering will come to perfection; that nothing America was in need of but this wholesome crash and wreck in misery and exposure; to make a long story short, that you'll profit immensely by the unheard-of depression. How do you like it? Ain't we the gallant undertakers? But let's drop it in the dung-hill, where it belongs.</p>
			<p>So you also are looking out for books? Thanks be to God that my opportunity has at last arrived! You want something to translate into American which I think is a little hard to find in our libraries, as our writers are slumbering since two hundred years. However, the most obvious name is here useless, as all your stage-men have already rifled it. I mean S. E. Pirandello. But perhaps over there a novel by him remains unknown: you could reveal it to an eager public: Il fu Mattia Pascal... Naturally it's now out of printing, but I'll get information immediately whether it is already translated, and where I can find a copy of it to mail you.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, not to let you change your mind, I'm mailing another novel, a masterpiece by our Sicilian novelist Giovanni Verga; the author of the plot of Cavalleria Rusticana, perhaps our greatest novelist of the nineteenth century with Alessandro Manzoni. I have inquired about and did not find it has already been translated into English. Think about it.</p>
			<p>Of course, I'm here ready to help you on whatever points I'll be able, from the meaning of certain Verga's idioms to copyright matters.</p>
