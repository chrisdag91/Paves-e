			<p>Ad Antonio Chiuminatto, Chicago.</p>
			<p>[Torino,] 9th Jan. '31</p>
			<p/>
			<p>Dear Tony,</p>
			<p>it's a rotten world this, ain't it? Now that you are so keen about helping me in the translation, it all turns out the other way round.</p>
			<p>You know, I already mailed the ms. to the publisher and I got only that copy of it and, when I'll receive the draughts to correct, I must send them back in two weeks. So I cannot, as it is my fond desire and your friendly offer, send the whole for you to look over.</p>
			<p>But I won't even trouble you with the book, for there are comparatively little cryptic sayings (Our Mr Wrenn is the first and so the least slangy of Lewis' works) in it and I found here a Webster's Dictionary which explained to me almost all of technical words. Yet there were your previous lists of phrases which served me a good turn. And so I want, now, nothing more than the explanation of this title of a song Waal I swan. (I think it has a spelling quite of its own).</p>
			<p>Certainly I regret that you cannot cast a glance on my Italian in order to improve and fix it but go on and speak to publishers!</p>
			<p>But there's consoling news: perhaps I'll undertake two more translations (I don't as yet know which) and then... I'll take advantages of you.</p>
			<p>Here is at last the mazooma of the Egg and the Testament: you seem badly injured by Christmas gifts...</p>
			<p>You read about these two books in my essay (if I'll ever put it down) and so, I think, soon. It would suffice to me now to have Hello Towns before the month has ended. Wipe from the list, if you're yet in time, Tar which I got here.</p>
			<p>About City Block you surely must send it (when you will have it back) and as you are such a bosom-friend of mine the dedication will be better yet than done for me.</p>
			<p>And so you liked the essay, eh? I'm mightily glad, but keep an eye peeled. I'm a little devil of a writer and I don't say &quot;provincials&quot; in a bad sense: I mean Lewis' people are healthy, unsophisticated and strong. Get me?</p>
			<p>But I'm tickled to death by your proposition: to have some ideas of mine, printed in an American review! I'll sit on the top of the world.</p>
			<p>Lastly I got acquainted with some opinions of your foremost critics about the Nobel Prize. They all say it's an offence to America, a shame, etc., but I should like to have some of them highbrows here to teach them how to defend themselves. These guys seem to ignore that almost all great American writers were discovered in Europe before. So it was with W. Whitman, so with H. James, so with Lewis. In USA the average people read and like them but they cannot gainsay the laureated asses who are, as in the Old Country, the learned men, the profs, the scholars.</p>
			<p>And it is perhaps the greatest feebleness with you Americans, who are so healthy and youthful and forward-looking in everything, that you so much respect university men, stuffed with non-digested classical learning, the pettiest and damnedest buttinskies woman's love ever produced. Oh, how I should like to beat someone's block off in this quarrel about Lewis! I feel myself Italian to the marrow, a wop, (you remember Dante Alighieri's sentence) &quot;a coloro che cos√¨ ragionano si vuole rispondere col coltello e non con le parole&quot;.</p>
			<p>But I must stop otherwise I'll put on fire the sheet.</p>
			<p>Say to whomsoever you meet making fun or saying that Lewis is clever, but no creator, that a not-so-stupid-after-all Italian reader maintains that he (the &quot;whomsoever&quot;) is &quot;fesso&quot;, un cretino, un coglione, nay, not a &quot;coglione&quot; for to be such would require a degree of virility the speaker certainly has not.</p>
			<p>How do you like this?</p>
			<p>We are yet the Renaissance rabble in Italy, ain't we?</p>
			<p>As for love, don't be afraid: &quot;know mammas and no kiddies&quot; is my motto.</p>
			<p>I like exceedingly your plan of economy about girl-friends and I'll try it, but, I fear, it will succeed only the first time.</p>
			<p>And send books books books I'm here roaring for books, for American books to guzzle. By the way look after a tract, that must be published in a magazine named Forum: it is by a George Frederic Nieberg, entitled The American Slanguage. I - and methinks you also - should like to glance it over.</p>
			<p>I don't know anything about Death takes a Holiday. Perhaps the title has been changed, and then... Moreover, I'm quite disinterested in theatrical shows. I prefer movies (another heresy that would send afire your learned people).</p>
