			<p>Ad <persName ref="https://viaf.org/viaf/120757469/" type="real">Antonio Chiuminatto</persName>, <placeName ref="https://geonames.org/4887398" type="real">Chicago</placeName>.</p>
			<p>[Torino, maggio 1931]</p>
			<p/>
			<p>Dear <persName ref="https://viaf.org/viaf/120757469/" type="real">Tony</persName>,</p>
			<p>at last I succeeded in putting down another essay on that guy. Say it's not so damn easy to rewrite on a topic! I had to plug along like a dog, believe me. But you'll soon get it and this matters, all other things "are silence". Now let Father Parsons decide.</p>
			<p>And I'm not due to America. 'Tis sad, honey, but 'tis so. On 1st November I'll enter under the arms. That doggone doctor found me able-bodied to war and peace service. Eleven months! Till June 1932. Adieu America! And I had already rec'd the Columbia acceptance! Surely Daddy above is a funny guy, you bet.</p>
			<p>So you can forward the library-stuff, according the list you already got, I beseech you, enclose Caroling Dusk. I want it before all other books.</p>
			<p>As you, say you like so much Anderson's Notebook, I'll mail it back, it's truly interesting and worthwhile, and I'm only sorry I read it after my Anderson was already in proofs (by the way, it'll appear before long). Together with the Notebook and the new essay on Lewis you'll get a novelty, my own translation of Our Mr Wrenn! You'll judge by your own eyes.</p>
			<p>Say, you're really tough, my boy, when it comes down to brass-tacks. You get along with the translation of that whole grammar (methinks you'll spend less time and fatigue in writing a new one). However many thanks and... a buon rendere.</p>
			<p>As for Mila he's turning out a regular four-flusher. What's more, he picked out somewhere a light-hearted widow and he's now sowing as many wild oats as you can conceive. Speak about writing to cronies! I'm not even myself seeing him, you know.</p>
			<p>But that's more news. A desperado-publisher will perhaps undertake my old study about your older Whitman and so make me a world-famous scholar about American literature. Should it turn out good, I'll be... hanged... no, I'll be sure to find a new place somewhere in scholarly America and so, after my damned term in the army, hug and kiss at last <rs ref="https://viaf.org/viaf/120757469/">my unique friend</rs>, over there.</p>
			<p>Now, I stop to hurry and get typewritten the everlasting essay. Toodle-oo and come over sometime.</p>
