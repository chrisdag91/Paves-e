			<p>Ad Antonio Chiuminatto, Chicago.</p>
			<p>[Torino,] July 20th 1930</p>
			<p/>
			<p>Dear me,</p>
			<p>now I'm writing, I've just finished my essay. Some amendments yet, and it'll be ready. You see, I've not only already read the whole of the Lewis you sent me, but also criticized him. In some days, I'll pack, get registered and mail the eight books. I'm already through the Cummings and Lowell and beginning the Ben Hecht of the first package. Look me over! I wonder if ever there was in U.S.A. such a snappy eater of American language.</p>
			<p>To day I got your kindly gift and toil of The Big House for which I've only, as it is my habit, to thank you, waiting for some occasion to reciprocate. As for the toil - the &quot;comment &quot; - I can only say that you got the same sharp eye of your previous lists in the choice of the difficult words and expressions and that you are the slickest teacher I ever enjoyed.</p>
			<p>Thanks to you a thousand times. Say, you are a kind of bewildered and staring in your photo of Columbia News: the new dignity locate you in the Heavens? There's a swell bunch of hot mamas, seems to me, in the school and you are always the old good mixer-and-cake-eater (ah!)</p>
			<p>By the way, the sweets you got where not the sweets I intended to send you. There must have been a larceny in the customs, or, as I think it highly improbable that people there could get chocolates to fill again the box, it must be that doggone moll there in the &quot;Sweets&quot; who assured me they would have packed, they have mailed, they done the whole thing and after, instead of a box of Perugina and Preferiti she reached out chocolate-centers.</p>
			<p>I'll yet speak about this. But you are unguilty and, moreover, you are yet dry, so you expect in a month or two to get true &quot;wet&quot; chocolates to repair. As yet, I don't know anything sure from &quot;my&quot; Columbia, but I'm in corrispondence with them and hope and dream. Would it not be a grand thing, were it only for the frolick you and I would have in old Manhattan? But it will go, it will go, by jiminy! I bet on it my whole life's blood.</p>
			<p>As for the Lewis I read, you know, maybe he's not the great corker? There are, at least, three of your books - The Innocent, Free Air and Elmer Gantry - which can match with Babbitt and Our Mr Wrenn and The job I had already, were not less. He's a genius, your Sinclair. I had a lot to say about him and yet I've only expressed a bit of what I found and admired in him. It'll require a long stretch, before I get the essay printed - some months they say, &quot;you understand, precedently accepted writings&quot; - but you will be, if not the first to read it, the last at least to forget it - it is your work.</p>
			<p>And now, with your kindly permission, I go &quot;to hit the hay&quot; as I am ossified by a whole day of poling on the Eridanus - commonly, by the &quot;tote t√ºrineise&quot; called the Po.</p>
			<p>Good night old socks and keep remembering your</p>
			<p>Cesare Pavese</p>
			<p/>
			<p>P.S. I thank - I'll die thanking - you also infinitely for the trouble you took typing that article by Ch. C. Baldwin. I found it very useful and interesting and should like, in order to have it quoted on the review, to know where and when you found it: that is, the title of the newspaper or magazine, in which it appeared, and its date.</p>
