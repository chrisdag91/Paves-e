			<p>Ad Antonio Chiuminatto, Chicago.</p>
			<p>[Torino,] 31 luglio 1930</p>
			<p/>
			<p>My dear Prof.,</p>
			<p>Here is at last another literary specimen of mine to enjoy yourself. (You seem to fancy them).</p>
			<p>I'll begin shrieking Haboy for your corking lingo - you are the most wonderful slanger (does it go?), nay you are turning out a regular writer, a creator of speech. I think someday the manager of &quot;my&quot; sheet will send me a best-seller by Mr Chiuminatto-Haliburton to review. I won't fail then to point out my previous friendship with the Big Boy.</p>
			<p>Do you know, Tony, that my essay (I beg y.p.: my and your essay) has done kind of a hit in the office of the manager and editor etc.? It will appear on the issue of September - maybe we are not so slow in the Old Land, eh? - and, tear your hair! they asked me for another of them criticisms on Sh. Anderson, our good old Sh. Anderson, whose complete works you will now have to find out, and borrow and send me. I hope you'll now compare no more your gracious self to the forsaken wife of gone-by days. Won't you?</p>
			<p>Really, could you - which I think, at this season of the year, a little difficult - gather for me the works I want, I should be exceedingly grateful to your person.</p>
			<p>I am expected to hand over my essay before New Year's Eve and so, you see, we have plenty of time to ferret out and mail and read the books. I'm, together with this letter, mailing back to you the Lewis with thanks to your friend Cand. Cady, and in some days I'll also have finished and packed the other ones: I've only three more of them to wade through.</p>
			<p>So you think about the following books:</p>
			<p/>
			<p>Sherwood Anderson:</p>
			<p>Windy McPherson's Son (1916)</p>
			<p>Marching Men (1917)</p>
			<p>Mid-American Chants (poems - 1918)</p>
			<p>Winesburg Ohio (1919)</p>
			<p>Poor White (1920)</p>
			<p>The Triumph of the Egg (1921)</p>
			<p>Many Marriages (1922)</p>
			<p>Note Book (1926)</p>
			<p>Tar (1926)</p>
			<p/>
			<p>Dark Laughter I already possess, A Storyteller's Story you sent Max, Horses and Men and A New Testament were in your last package and I read them. However, I should be gratified, could you in your future Anderson package also include A New Testament, as it is a very difficult and important work and such as I should like to glance at during the composition of my essay. Get me? Naturally if you find out some unspoken of work of Anderson, reach it out with the rest. And also, va sans dire, I should be your life-long slave, could you send me some criticism on the subject, the important and not-to-be-done-without ones. And remember, pray, to always note the date and place (title of the newspaper) of the eventual ones. And yet, this is the last blow, I should like to get together with Anderson's, the following two books by Gertrude Stein Tender Buttons, The Making of Americans (Anderson has been influenced by her).</p>
			<p>Now, we are arranged and you'll have to run about with a new pair of shoes. What do you think of your lil old flea-in-the-drawers of a friend? Make it snappy, Amuriccano.</p>
			<p>You see, my kidding is a little heavier than yours and his gist is always some unending trouble for the fellow. This sort is the renowned European kidding. How do you like it?</p>
			<p>Now, I thank you another time for the gift of The Big House which is truly a gold mine of slang, a thing to be studied by heart. My admiration for your wonderful new language (about which I wrote &quot;something&quot; also in my essay) has yet increased since the pleasure of your unforgettable conversation and to my eyes you are now the hero, the saint, representative of a new religion.</p>
			<p>I adore words. For instance &quot;here is at last the promised doremi&quot; what's more wonderful than this? And there are score of it!</p>
			<p>As for Columbia I don't yet know anything sure. Now pardon me my long silence and have a friendly wallop on the shoulder by your</p>
			<p>C</p>
			<p/>
			<p>P.S. Would you mind sending me a good explanation of the words: bromide (bromidic), G. M. (after a hour) dope-fiend - up-de-dee - I don't film well to panhandle?</p>
