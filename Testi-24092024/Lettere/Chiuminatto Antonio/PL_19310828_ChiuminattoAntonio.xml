			<p>Ad Antonio Chiuminatto, Chicago.</p>
			<p>[Torino,] 28th Aug. [1931]</p>
			<p/>
			<p>Dear Tony,</p>
			<p>I hope you'll have received the first package of books I sent you on the 6th of August. Here's another set and so the whole is on its way home again.</p>
			<p>Many good things I got from them: you're truly a grand booster of USA abroad. All I knew in this line I must own from you.</p>
			<p>I worked manly this summer and before long you'll get &quot;printed stuff&quot; to testify of it.</p>
			<p>Say, there's corking news for me and you to know: I'll not go under arms! I'll acquit myself with some pre-military courses, on Sundays, and remain a civilian all the time.</p>
			<p>America looms again in the skies.</p>
			<p>I spoke at last with Max (by the way, he's reduced to a shadow of his former self, sex-appeal appealed too much on him), we'll arrange the Rassegna affair. On the August issue there's a good article of our chum on music and movies: it means something here in Italy. America plays a standing role in it, you bet.</p>
			<p>Please accept some bootleg hootch to start your dreams with, hope will get you in good shape. 'Tis so, you feed my mind with books, and I try to reciprocate by feeding your sins: who has the best of it?</p>
			<p>Wishing you a happy father of many a spiritual child, here's my paw. Toodle-oodle</p>
			<p>Cesare</p>
			<p/>
			<p>P.S. They are three the packages I'm mailing to-day: two of books and one of liquor-centers. Perhaps the last will get injured, let us hope.</p>
